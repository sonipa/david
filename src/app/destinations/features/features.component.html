  <p>Once <u (click)="openHypercard();" matTooltip="What's Hypercard?"  [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">Hypercard</u> came out, I began to focus on development. Before the web, I made a <u (click)="openBBS();" matTooltip="What's a BBS?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">Wildcat BBS</u> and became a sysop.</p>
  <p>These days, I use <u (click)="openFrameworks();" matTooltip="Frameworks? Libraries?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">frameworks and libraries</u> to build things. I also like to use cameras. Using cameras is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
