<h1>Now</h1>
<p>The development and design worlds are filled with projects. As they appear and improve over time their version numbers increase.</p>
<mat-grid-list cols="1" rowHeight="3:1">
  <mat-grid-tile (click)="showOverlay('Versions Larger','Versions', 'Some of the')" class="view-larger-link" matTooltip="View Larger"  [matTooltipPosition]="'before'">versions illustration</mat-grid-tile>
</mat-grid-list>
<p>I like to think of age as our version number. We start at version 0.0.1 and eventually got to <i>now</i>. I think it would be fun to have a <u (click)="openChangeLog();" matTooltip="What's a changelog?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">changelog</u> rather than rely on memory.</p>
