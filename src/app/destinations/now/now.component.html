<h1>Now</h1>
<p>The journey that brought you to <strong>who you are now</strong> could be captured in a timeline as unique as your DNA. The current version of you.</p>
<p>The development and design worlds are filled with patterns and libraries. As they appear and improve over time their version numbers increase.</p>
<p>I like to think of age as a version number. We start at Version 0.0.1 and eventually got to now. It would be fun to have a release log full of bug fixes and new features to look back on.</p>
<p>I'll try to do that here rather than rely on memory.</p>
