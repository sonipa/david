<h1>Now</h1>
<p>The journey that brought you to <strong>who you are now</strong> could be captured in a timeline as unique as your DNA. The current version of you.</p>
<p>The development and design worlds are filled with projects. As they appear and improve over time their version numbers increase.</p>
<mat-grid-list cols="1" rowHeight="3:1">
  <mat-grid-tile>versions</mat-grid-tile>

<p>I like to think of age as a version number. We start at version 0.0.1 and eventually got to now. It would be fun to have a <u (click)="openChangeLog();" matTooltip="What's a changelog?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">changelog</u>. I'd rather have that than rely on memory.</p>
