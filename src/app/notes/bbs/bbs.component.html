  <div class="dp">A BBS is like a pre-internet website. People would use their modems to call your BBS's phone number. Once connected, they'd see your site.</div>
  <div class="dp">Many of the features you see in websites existed back then. The person who created and ran the BBS was the &ldquo;sysop&rdquo; or system operator.</div>
  <div class="dp">Wildcat was the program I used to manage my BBS. I was a kid living with my parents so the incoming modem calls were not convenient. The internet is way better.</div>
