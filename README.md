This (will be) the source for my site. The old one will be gone when this is ready, so get your last looks for the sort of broken version 2.1: [davidmulhern.com](http://davidmulhern.com)

Decisions:

* Dart
* Angular2

That's it so far.

### Instructions

* `pub install` to get started
* `pub serve` to work in live mode
* `pub build` to create static output

### 2.1 Where we left off

The old site was very jquery focused. I don't know what year that was. Very old. I still talk about being a "designer" in the past. That was a world before design was commoditized and when PHP still made sense. I'll just make the new site in Angular2 and keep the source here for now.
