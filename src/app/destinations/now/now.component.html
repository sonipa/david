  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p>The development and design worlds are filled with projects. As they appear and improve over time their version numbers increase.</p>
  <p>I like to think of age as <b>our</b> version number. We start at version zero and eventually got to <i>now</i>. I think it would be fun to have a <u (click)="openChangeLog();" matTooltip="What's a changelog?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">changelog</u> rather than rely on memory.</p>

  <h2>What now?</h2>
  <p>I'll try to use the <a [routerLink]="'/thoughts'">thoughts</a> area like a blog, making posts on various topics. You'll also find info on current and past versions of <a [routerLink]="'/about'">me</a>.</p>
