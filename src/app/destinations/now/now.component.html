<h1>Now</h1>
<p>The development and design worlds are filled with projects. As they appear and improve over time their version numbers increase.</p>

<p>I like to think of age as our version number. We start at version 0.0.1 and eventually got to now. I think it would be fun to have a <u (click)="openChangeLog();" matTooltip="What's a changelog?" [matTooltipPosition]="'below'">changelog</u> rather than rely on memory.</p>

<p>It depends on why you're here. You can check out a <a [routerLink]="'/timeline'">log</a> of past versions, see <a [routerLink]="'/features'">features</a> I have now, read my <a [routerLink]="'/thoughts'">thoughts</a> on various topics or browse <a [routerLink]="'/projects'">projects</a> I've worked on. There are also <a [routerLink]="'/about'">contact details</a>.</p>
