  <p>The <u>last time</u> I did this site, I used a template and talked about jQuery way too much. It was 2012. I've realized that I don't update the site enough to keep up with how fast technologies fall in and out of favour.</p>
  <p>This time around I'll try to focus on <b>who I am</b> rather than what tech things I'm using.</p>
